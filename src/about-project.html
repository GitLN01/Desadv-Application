                    this information. This project consists of both frontend and a backend, with the backend responsible for consuming and manipulating
                    the data, as well as persisting it in files or a database of choice.</p>
                  <p>
                    On the page <b>"Dashboard"</b>, as mentioned previously, users will be provided with a comprehensive dashboard to view and interact with inbound
                    DESADV data. Users will be able to visualize various metrics, apply filters, and generate dynamic charts to analyze the data effectively.

                          Hi, my name is Lazar Nikitović, and I could easily say that computers are a big part of my life.
                          It all started when I was a little child who was playing a lot of computer games. As time was moving
                          on, I was more and more interested in how games work, and that's where my passion for IT was born. Currently I am
                          student of third year in FTN Čačak, and I could say that I like it so far. During my high school years, I dived deeper
                          into the world of programming and started working on small personal projects. I loved the thrill of bringing ideas to
                          life through code. This experience only fueled my desire to pursue a career in software development.
                          Now, as a third-year student at FTN Čačak, I have had an opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills in various areas
                          of computer science. I've been mostly interested into data structures, algorithms, databases, web development, and more. Each new challenge
                          has only reinforced my belief that I'm on the right path. I am committed to delivering a high-quality application that not only meets
                          the project requirements but also showcases my technical abilities and problem-solving skills. With every line of code, I aim to
                          create something that will leave a positive impact on its users.
