# Quick note regarding the future of this application

I regret to inform you that the DESADV Application has been delayed in its development due to a late start on this project. My apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused. Currently, the DESADV Application is being worked on, offering basic file management and visualization features in an unfinished state.

I want to express my sincere apologies to Avnet Company for this delay. As of now, I will be actively engaged in enhancing the application. My focus is on implementing user authentication, search capabilities, and advanced visualization features to improve its functionality.

Additionally, I encountered some challenges while attempting to run a VM using Docker. Despite my efforts, I faced technical difficulties that have temporarily hindered progress. Rest assured, I am diligently working to address these issues and ensure that the DESADV Application development proceeds smoothly.
