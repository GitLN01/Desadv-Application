                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          File Upload and Management: Users can upload CSV files through the web interface.
                          Uploaded files are stored on the server for further processing and analysis.
                          A listing of uploaded files with details such as filename, upload date, and size is displayed to users.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          Data Visualization: The uploaded CSV data is processed and visualized in a tabular format using HTML tables.
                          The frontend dynamically renders tables based on the uploaded CSV files.
                          Users can interact with the visualized data, enabling efficient data exploration.
                        </li>
                
                        <li>
                          Pagination: Pagination is implemented to manage the display of a large number of files.
                          Users can navigate through pages of files using the pagination controls.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          File Details and Download: Users can click on a specific file in the listing to view detailed information.
                          The detailed view provides metadata such as filename, size, and upload date.
                          Users have the option to download the original CSV file for further use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          User-Friendly Interface: The frontend is designed with a responsive layout, ensuring usability across different devices.
                          Clear and concise labels and instructions guide users through the file management process.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Backend Processing: The backend is built using Node.js and Express, allowing for efficient handling of file uploads and processing.
                          Uploaded files are stored in a designated directory on the server.
                          CSV data is parsed and transformed as required for visualization and display.
                        </li>

                        The CSV File Management System serves as a practical solution for individuals or small teams dealing with a significant
                        amount of CSV data. While this application provides essential file management and visualization features, it can be further
                        extended to incorporate additional functionalities such as user authentication, search, and more advanced visualization options.
                        Users are advised to handle sensitive data with care and follow security best practices, especially if considering deploying the
                         application in production environments.
